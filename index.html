    A: `A. WHAT LITTLE THINGS!
By Madison Julius Cawein (from “One Day and Another”)

What little things are those
That hold our happiness!
A smile, a glance, a rose
Dropped from her hair or dress;
A word, a look, a touch,
These are so much, so much.

An air we can't forget;
A sunset's gold that gleams;
A spray of mignonette,
Will fill the soul with dreams
More than all history says,
Or romance of old days.

For of the human heart,
Not brain, is memory;
These things it makes a part
Of its own entity;
The joys, the pains whereof
Are the very food of love.`,

    B: `B. PLANT INTELLIGENCE
 
Plants are considered life-support on Earth because of the countless things they provide to the entire biosphere. With their great significance and surprising qualities, many scientists were drawn to consider whether plants have feelings or possess some degree of intelligence. While many people believe that plants do not have any emotions as people do, plants do show signs of responding to their environment. At present, many studies have been conducted to discover the possibility that plants exhibit intelligence or, at the least, can feel.
 
Many plant biologists and botanists use the term “neural activity” to describe plant behavior despite the fact that plants do not have brains or neurons. One remarkable study that demonstrates such activity was done by Bohm J., et al. (2016), as cited by Trewavas (2016), on a Venus fly-trap, a plant that captures and consumes a variety of small flying insects. After carefully examining the behavior of the said carnivorous plant, the researchers concluded that the Venus fly-trap can actually “count” up to five. Their assumption was based on the following observations:
 
As a fly-trap hair is touched the first time, the plant makes no response.
 
When a second hair is touched within 20 seconds, the open petals of the plant snap shut, trapping its potential meal.
 
As the insect begins to struggle, at the third touch of a plant hair, the plant again makes no response.
 
The same lack of response occurs the fourth time a plant hair is stimulated.
 
Only with the fifth hair touch do the plant’s digestive enzymes start the process of digesting its prey.
 
The abovementioned observations can be interpreted as the fly-trap’s knowledge of when best to attack prey and avoid false starts. These may not be an indication of a plant’s intelligence comparable to humans, but they show that plants somehow feel because of their response to their environment.

    C: `C. GET TO KNOW PAGASA’S RAINFALL WARNINGS
 
The Philippines is visited by an average of 20 typhoons a year. Some are very strong, bringing heavy rains and causing floods in many areas. In 2012, PAGASA started using color-coded rainfall advisories. These were classified into three levels: Yellow, Orange, and Red.
 
The Yellow Rainfall Warning means that there will be heavy rainfall of 7.5 to 15 mm in an hour, which may continue for the next two hours. Flooding is possible in affected areas. The public is advised to check weather bulletin updates.
 
The Orange Rainfall Warning means that there will be intense rainfall of 15 to 30 mm in an hour, which may continue for the next two hours. Flooding is expected in affected areas. Residents must be ready for possible evacuation.
 
The Red Rainfall Warning means that there will be torrential rainfall of more than 30 mm in an hour, which may continue for the next two hours. It is also issued when rainfall of more than 65 mm continues for three hours. Serious flooding is expected. Residents should start evacuating.
 
Through these color-coded rainfall warnings, citizens become better prepared for typhoons.
